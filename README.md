# NYCHA Energy Consumption Analysis (2010â€“2024)

This project explores 15 years of electricity cost and consumption data from NYC's Housing Authority (NYCHA), using both Python and Tableau to identify cost trends, seasonal patterns, and inefficiencies across boroughs and developments.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Course**: CIS 4170  
- **Title**: *15 Years of Power: NYCHAâ€™s Energy Cost Journey (2010â€“2025)*
- **Author**: Hao Le
- **Data Source**: [NYC Open Data â€“ NYCHA Electric Consumption & Cost](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Electric-Consumption-And-Cost-2010-Feb-2025-/jr24-e7cr)
- **Tableu Public** : https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hao.le5278/viz/NYCHA_Consumption/NYCHAEnergyCost2010-2025?publish=yes

## Key Questions

- Which boroughs and developments have the highest electricity costs?
- How have costs changed over time?
- Are rising charges driven by usage or by price per KWH?
- What are the seasonal patterns in cost and efficiency?
- What components make up NYCHAâ€™s total energy bill?
